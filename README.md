# Site created from tutorial in "Web Development with Node and Express"

The book is written by [Ethan Brown](https://www.popart.com/about-us/team/ethan-brown)
and is published by O'Reilly Media

This is what you'll get if you follow along with the tutorial from [the book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032977.do), with the one exception that the tutorial uses Grunt, while Gulp is used here.

The book is very well written, and I can thoroughly recommend it (I have no affiliation with O'Reilly).
