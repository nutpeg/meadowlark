# Site created from tutorial in "Web Development with Node and Express"

This repo is the result of following the turorial in ["Web Development with Node and Express"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032977.do), which is written by [Ethan Brown](https://www.popart.com/about-us/team/ethan-brown)
and published by O'Reilly Media. The one difference is that Gulp is used here rather than Grunt. 

See the Ethan Brown's official repo [here](https://github.com/EthanRBrown/web-development-with-node-and-express).

The book is very well written, and I can thoroughly recommend it (I have no affiliation with O'Reilly).
